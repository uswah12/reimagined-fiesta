- Notes as of commit `f28fc28`.

## General advice and literature

- You're obviously writing working code, as the Rosalind problems are being solved. That's excellent!

- I don't think I shared with you this link to papers for students primarily based in the wet-lab who are starting to get involved in computational biology. Only the first few papers will be immediately relevant to you (the rest will become more appropriate as your skills develop further)

### File naming

- In this repo your scripts don't have a suffix.
    - Python scripts should have an appropriate file ending - usually `.py`, e.g. `myscript.py`.
    - This enables automatic file association with an appropriate Python runtime, or code editor.
    - It also helps mere humans tell what's a script and what's not ;)

- In this repo, your script names have spaces in them.
    - Modern filesystems can cope with spaces in filenames - just about. They use tricks behind the scenes to make this possible.
    - The main problem is that spaces are the primary *delimiter* when running code at the command line. For instance, to copy a file from one location to another, you'd run a command like:

    ```bash
    cp file1.py file2.py
    ```

    - Here, the command (`cp`) and each file (`file1.py`, `file2.py`) are *delimited* by a space character.
    - The problem arises because not all operating systems or all software can tell when you mean a space as a delimiter, or as a space in a single filename. For instance, the following requires the computer to *know* that a single file is called `Strings and Lists` - but it doesn't know that automatically:

    ```bash
    cp Strings and Lists myfile2.txt
    ```

    - You can be explicit to the computer and type:

    ```bash
    cp "Strings and Lists" myfile2.txt
    ```

    - or

    ```bash
    cp Strings\ and\ Lists myfile2.txt
    ```

    - and both will work, but this is a frequent source of bugs and problems. Not all of those problems are easy to find!
    - It is good practice *never* to use spaces in filenames, but to replace them with another character, such as the underscore, as in: `Strings_and_Lists.py`.

### More advanced topics

- The [`shebang`](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Shebang)
    - This is a special series of characters which, when present at the start of a file, tell the (Linux/Unix/macOS) computer to treat it as a program.
    - It takes the form:

    ```bash
    #!<SOME STUFF>
    ```

    - and the `#!` (hash-bang) is known as a *shebang*, for some reason.
    - The appropriate shebang for Python can vary from computer to computer, but the most flexible - almost universal - form is this:

    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    ```

    - This does two things:
        - It links in to the `env` system on the computer (try executing `env` at the command-line!). This stores a large set of variables in the environment, that point to locations of files, or store useful constants (like your user name).
        - One of these things it stores is the location of the `python` runtime that will execute your script.
        - The effect of using `/usr/bin/env python` is to always find a Python installation, regardless of which computer you're running on. (Windows ignores it and guesses from the suffix, IIRC).

- General style, spaces vs Tabs, and how many spaces
    - The short answer is always indent Python with spaces. You're currently using eight spaces, which can lead to some very long lines and difficult-to-read code.
        - There's no hard and fast rule about how many spaces
        - Most code I read uses four, as a trade-off between readability and clear indentation
        - There is usually a setting in your editor that allows you to change the number of spaces in an indent.
    - The Python style guide ([PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces)) is an easy read and lays out good style practice in Python.
        - You can get automated advice on how your code complies with PEP8/good style by installing the `pycodestyle` package and running it on a file. For instance:

        ```bash
        $ conda install pycodestyle
        $ pycodestyle "Strings and Lists"
        Strings and Lists:1:1: E265 block comment should start with '# '
        Strings and Lists:1:80: E501 line too long (81 > 79 characters)
        Strings and Lists:2:1: E265 block comment should start with '# '
        Strings and Lists:2:80: E501 line too long (183 > 79 characters)
        Strings and Lists:9:2: E225 missing whitespace around operator
        Strings and Lists:10:2: E225 missing whitespace around operator
        Strings and Lists:11:2: E225 missing whitespace around operator
        Strings and Lists:12:2: E225 missing whitespace around operator
        ```

        - The "advice" it gives can sometimes seem a bit impersonal and harsh, but if you make your code comply with `pycodestyle` it will read better.
        - There are other tools that will also inspect your code and make suggestions for improvement, such as `flake8`, `pylint`, `black`, and so on. It's probably a little early for you to be using them, but as you start to write more ambitious programs, you should look into them a bit.

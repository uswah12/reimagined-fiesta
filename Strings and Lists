#Given: A string s of length at most 200 letters and four integers a, b, c and d.
#Return: The slice of this string from indices a through b and c through d (with space in between), inclusively. In other words, we should include elements s[b] and s[d] in our slice.

# below is not my code  however using it for future reference
